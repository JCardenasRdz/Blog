    "Non-linear curve fitting is a fundamental part of the quantitative analysis performed in multiple scientific disciplines.\n",
    "The main idea is that we know (or assume) the model that describes an observed data.\n",

    "\n",
    "We could assume that the data is described by a number of different models, but an exponential decay is reasonable option. Thus if we assumed our dat is described by the following model:\n",

    "The question now becomes how to determine the values of 'Mz' and 'T1' knowing the observed data and the assumes model. This is what we do:\n",
